Output : 

Enter total no of the students : 4
enter no.of students present for the test : 3
Enter marks of the  3  students in the FDS : 

45
67
89

FDS marks of all the sudents are :
 [45, 67, 89]

a) The average score of the class :  50.25

b) Highest score of the class :  89
   lowest score of the class :  45

c) Count of the student who were absent for the test :  1

d) Display mark with highest frequency :  89
